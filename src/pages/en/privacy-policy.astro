        on this site.
    </p>

    <h3>What are cookies?</h3>

    <p>
        Cookies are small text files that websites visited by users send to
        their terminals (usually to the browser), where they are stored to be
        then retransmitted to the same sites during the user's next visit.
    </p>

    <h3>Cookies used by this site</h3>

    <p>
        This site uses both technical cookies, which do not require consent,
        and functional cookies, which are installed only with your prior
        consent.
    </p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Cookie Name</th>

    <h3>How to manage cookie preferences</h3>

    <p>
        On your first access to the site, you are shown a banner through which
        you can choose whether to accept or reject the installation of
        functional cookies. You can change your choice at any time.
