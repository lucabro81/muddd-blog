- You arrive at the main entrance.
It's not what you expected.
There's no drawbridge thundering down, no guards checking,
no movement of any kind.
The portals you see are half-open, as if they were left open for a brief moment
that never ended...

<TitleLined class="title-lined">
  <h2 id="the-idea">The Idea</h2>
</TitleLined>

<p>
  The blinking cursor, the movement command, and the description of the world
  around you forming one word at a time, sealing your fate.
</p>

<p>
  It's nothing new, things like this have existed since the internet began, but
  what could give an extra dimension to this medium? What if it could
  suggest a spark of consciousness? A world that isn't static, but that
  changes with time and events.
</p>

<p>
  A textual world that remembers yesterday's battle by describing today the smoking ruins
  that bear witness to it, in a unique way, every time this happens.
</p>

<p>
  A story generated moment by moment, without its creator having
  foreseen its details.
</p>

<p>
  I'm Luca, I write code, and this is the experiment I've decided to set up
  to answer these questions.
</p>

<p>
  What happens if, instead of creating a static world, we make it evolve over
  time? If we take an LLM and have it generate a world, interactions, actions, choices and decisions? All in real time?
</p>

<p>
  Honest answer? A lot of unpleasant things, examples abound, between
  hallucinations and bias there's an embarrassment of riches. It's only a matter of
  time before it starts babbling nonsense with enviable confidence.
</p>

<p>
  However, if we take this LLM, even one that's not particularly large, and we
  equip it with specific training, a solid and exhaustive dataset to
  draw knowledge from, and a well-engineered prompt, then the result
  changes. We can get a <strong>Narrator</strong>. An entity that decides
  what to tell, what to show, what to hide, in a way that's consistent with the
  context, with the choices made and with the actions taken. If two players or
  NPCs have fought, for example, we could get something like this:
</p>

```
> look

- The air smells of ozone, burns on the walls and charred furniture:
a clash between magical energies has just taken place.

> health

- 2/10 HP

Your right shoulder throbs with pain: the acid arrow that hit you earlier has left
a nasty wound that can only heal with proper care, you need to find a healer and fast!
```

<p>
  When I started playing, moving in this type of world made of words,
  it wasn't easy. Virtual worlds in 2D or 3D were already there,
  relieving the effort of having to imagine everything: they were admired,
  the response was immediate, filling the eyes.
  Wonderful, certainly, but for all their liveliness and pulsation, in my personal opinion and experience, they lack that granularity that makes a certain moment unique and indeed unrepeatable.
</p>

<p>
  The textual world, instead, asks the player for commitment. It takes effort
  to sit there and imagine, and it's not certain you'll succeed right away, it's
  necessary to trust this process.
</p>

<p>
  And this is where our idea comes back into play. If the AI Narrator we've
  built helps us tailor a corner of the world based on what
  happened before and the state of the world, that initial effort is mitigated. If everything responds
  sensibly, the static world limit is no longer felt and the
  player's trust is instantly rewarded.
</p>

<p>
  **MUDDD** (Multi User Data Driven Dungeon) is this: the attempt to bring
  these two worlds together. To see if well-written and dynamically
  generated text can make a textual universe more alive and convincing than any
  graphics, removing the limits of a graphics and physics engine and pre-generated assets,
  without needing ultra-performant GPUs. It's an experiment to
  see if this idea can stand on its own legs.

    No explorer sets out without a map, however incomplete. This
    frontier isn't born from nothing, but rests on the ruins and foundations of
    worlds that preceded us and formed a way of storytelling. My
    work aims to be a tribute to two great schools of thought. On one hand,
    the robustness of <a href="https://dikumud.com/" _target="_blank">DikuMUD</a> and their
    derivatives (I believe the very first one I played was <a href="https://www.clessidra.it/" _target="_blank">Clessidra</a>), which defined the
    mechanics, combat and progression that for decades have been the
    backbone of online role-playing games.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  On the other hand, the ambition of persistent worlds like 
  <a href="https://uo.com/" _target="_blank">Ultima Online</a>, where player actions
  left scars and created stories visible to all. 
  <strong>MUDDD</strong> doesn't seek to reinvent the wheel of mechanics, but
  to take that solid framework and mount a completely new narrative engine on it,
  one that's alive and unpredictable.
</p>

<TitleLined class="title-lined">
  <h2 id="the-state-of-the-art">The State of the Art</h2>
</TitleLined>

<p>
  A frontier, by definition, has few inhabitants, but I'm not the first to
  have planted a flag in these unexplored lands. There are already notable projects
  that use generative AI to create textual experiences, and it's right to
  acknowledge them to understand where <strong>MUDDD</strong> stands.
</p>

<p>
  One that has most attracted my attention is undoubtedly
  <a href="https://aidungeon.com/" _target="_blank">AI Dungeon</a>. It's a fascinating project
  that offers almost absolute freedom, allowing the player to do
  literally anything in a single-player adventure generated on
  the fly, I won't speak now of what doesn't convince me about that approach, but it's
  a project that has given enormous impetus to the world of dynamic storytelling.
  It's an incredibly powerful story simulator, a true sandbox
  for the imagination.
</p>

<p>
  My approach, however, differs in three fundamental aspects.
  <strong>MUDDD</strong> doesn't want to be a sandbox, or, at least, not _only_
  a sandbox and not _so_ sandbox, but a multiplayer game world with rules and
  persistence.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>MUDDD</strong> has a game structure, with statistics, abilities and objectives. 
    A system of events and characteristics to apply to world entities that influence their narrative rendering. 
    It's a role-playing game, not an improvisation.
  </li>

  <li>
    The purpose of <strong>MUDDD</strong> is to create primarily a persistent
    world, with dynamic evolution as a consequence of choices made by
    players, with (almost) infinite granularity.
  </li>

  <li>
    Although this project also allows exclusively single-player
    storytelling, it's not its main purpose. Interaction between players must
    exist, and the LLM is an engine that can facilitate it.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Beyond this, I'm certain there are other projects that have followed this
  same path; we won't list them now, but they could be the subject of other
  posts and other analyses. However, this project is inspired by these attempts
  and seeks to apply this logic to the entire fabric of the game world and
  those who inhabit it.
</p>

  <h2 id="objectives">Objectives</h2>
</TitleLined>

<p>
  This frontier will grow according to this compass:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    **Narrative Persistence:** I want a world that remembers. If a guild
    builds an outpost or a dragon razes a village to the ground, the
    textual descriptions of those areas must change forever, reflecting
    the new reality without manual intervention, the result must emerge from the data.
  </li>
  <li>
    **A "Leashed" AI:** although I've had some ideas where
    the unreliability of narration based on LLM choices could
    make sense, generally speaking this shouldn't be a sort of chaotic
    god, but a Narrator that respects the canon, a script indicated to it
    during the design phase. It will be bound to predetermined lore, physical rules
    and a "memory" of past events, to guarantee coherence and
    immersion.
  </li>
  <li>
    **Collective Dynamism:** The heart of the experiment, and it's a nuance of the
    first point, but it's seeing how the world evolves under the pressure of a
    community. Will descriptions of a forest change if a guild of lumberjacks
    starts to deforest it? Will roads become safer if players
    patrol trade routes?
  </li>
  <li>
    **Focus on the Engine:** Before being a game, **MUDDD** is the construction
    of a narrative engine. Much of these "Notes from the Frontier" will
    focus on technical challenges, solutions found and lessons
    learned in the attempt to bring this vision to life.
  </li>
</ul>

<TitleLined class="title-lined">
  <h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
</TitleLined>

<p>The question that might arise, and that I asked myself too, is:</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>
  But what do I know :), maybe the more correct question is:
</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>
  We evolved to explore and understand, learn, know and
  apply, from Ulysses to Carl Sagan. I want to see how far we can get and
  maybe let others continue from where I left off.
</p>

<p>
  There's room for everyone, and if you want to accompany me, please make yourselves heard.
